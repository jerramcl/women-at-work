The purpose of this study is to examine gender disparities in salaries and leadership representation within the business sector. By analyzing the wage gap between men and women, particularly in leadership roles, and assessing the factors that influence women's underrepresentation in leadership, this study aims to provide insights into potential barriers to gender equity in the workplace.

The data comes for the 2021 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG). This is a dataset maintained by the National Science Foundation (NSF) that provides comprehensive information on the education, employment, and demographic characteristics of individuals with a bachelorâ€™s degree or higher in the United States.

The main anlysis involved a regression model examining wage differentials by gender, specifically within the business sector. A binary variable for the business sector was added alongside controls for years at a job, partnered status with children, professional training, and education level to account for key factors influencing salary. Variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis confirmed low multicollinearity. The results showed that women earn approximately 84% of what men earn, longer job tenure increases salary by 1%, and having a partner with children correlates with a 14% higher salary. Professional training offers a modest 2.5% wage increase, while higher education leads to greater earnings. Working in the business sector is associated with a 1.36% salary increase. All findings are statistically significant at the 5% level. 

To further investigate gender-based wage differences in business, an interaction term between gender and business sector wwas introduced to isolate the compounded effect on salary. I found that the coefficient of interest, on the interaction between gender and belonging to the business sector, shows that women in the business sector make less than men in the business sector. I also found that the overall effect of working in the business sector leads to a positive increase in salary for both men and women, but women do not benefit as much as men do from this salary boost. Ultimately, this study shred light on the ever-present gender disparties within the workplace, and provides evidence the need of DEI and other measures to combat there inequalities.
